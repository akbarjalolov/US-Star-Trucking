           Military members

          </h5>
          <p>
        On average, most military families move every 2 to 3 years. If you’ve been in the military long enough, then you’ve surely experienced this for yourself. Every time you receive military PCS orders for a Permanent Change of Station, things can get hectic.

Each time you have to pack up and move, it can be quite a headache. Not only do you have to get everything together and travel across the country, but you also have to unpack and settled in. When you have to do this every other year, it can get exhausting.

Thankfully, there are a few things you can do to make each move easier. For example, you can have military PCS vehicle shipping done for you so you can focus on everything else. When Nexus works with a client, military customers can rest assured that we’ve got things covered for their next big move.

Have we got your attention about our military car shipping service? Then keep reading. We’ll provide all of the information that military personnel needs to ship your car safely, affordably, and with confidence.
